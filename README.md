# recommended-content-list
Simple web app that allows for teacher-to-student sharing of course relevant content.

This is a bare minimum Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to share content from their mobile devices using the Web Share API.

## Project Structure

├── src
│   ├── index.html       # Main HTML document for the PWA
│   ├── styles.css       # Styles for the application
│   └── app.js           # JavaScript code for functionality
├── manifest.json        # Web app manifest for metadata
├── service-worker.js     # Service worker for offline capabilities
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

This PWA has been modified to be run from GitHub Pages.
(That means some of the URLs for accessing favicons & js files have `/recommended-content-list/` prepended.)

## Features

- Basic layout and styling
- Share functionality using the Web Share API
- Offline capabilities through service worker

## Future Enhancements

- Add more features and content
- Improve styling and user experience
- Implement additional caching strategies in the service worker
